A reproduction of the SEGA 839-1187 analog amplifier board, useable in several games. This project is already shared on OSH Park here: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/Y6ouPNpT but you can also use the KiCad project to generate gerbers for your favorite PCB fabricator. Also, see `839-1187 clone.txt` for BOM and links for purchasing, and see the `bom/` directory for an interactive BOM page that makes assembly easier. Enjoy and happy Monkey Balling!
